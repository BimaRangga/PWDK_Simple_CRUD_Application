# PWDK_Simple_CRUD_Application
The following is a Capstone assignment with the theme Employee Data given to me by Purwadhika Digital Technology School.  In this task I made a simple program about employee data at a company, where there is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) feature in the program.

In the Read feature, I created a program so that it can read all employee lists, all unique data in the Department and Position columns, and the list of employees you want to search according to the specifications needed (ex: employees with a certain salary, employees in a certain department/position, or employees with a specific name).

The Create feature has a feature where users can add new employee data and if the newly added data has an existing EmployeeID, the program will notify that the EmployeeID data already exists and no data will be added. In addition, if someone is entered who has an EmployeeID that is different from all existing entries, the program will give the option to add the data or not.

In the update feature, users can replace an employee's data with specific data they have. The specific data in question is the data in the Name, Status, and EmployeeID columns. Next, the program displays some employee data and asks the user to enter the EmployeeID of the employee you want to update. In updating data, the user can replace some data in different columns according to the user's wishes

Delete feature, in this feature the user can delete several employee data at once by entering the name of the employee who wants to be deleted then the program will display data with the name entered by the user and ask the user to enter one or several EmployeeIDs that they want to delete or the user can also delete all employee data that has resign status
