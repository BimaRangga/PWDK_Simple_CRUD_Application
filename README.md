# PWDK_Project_Capstone
The following is a Capstone assignment with the theme Employee Data given to me by Purwadhika Digital Technology School.  In this task I made a simple program about employee data at a company, where there is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) feature in the program.
In the Read feature, I created a program so that it can read all employee lists, all unique data in the Department and Position columns, and the list of employees you want to search according to the specifications needed (ex: employees with a certain salary, employees in a certain department/position, or employees with a specific name).
The Create feature has a feature where users can add new employee data and if the newly added data has an existing EmployeeID, the program will notify that the EmployeeID data already exists and no data will be added. In addition, if someone is entered who has an EmployeeID that is different from all existing entries, the program will give the option to add the data or not.
